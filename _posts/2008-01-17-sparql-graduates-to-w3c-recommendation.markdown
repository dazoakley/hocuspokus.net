I watched a presentation on this about 18 months ago at a conference and it looked pretty interesting -
some good potential applications in the scientific field. Glad to see things are progressing.

> "The W3C just gave SPARQL the stamp of approval. SPARQL is a query language for the Semantic Web, and
> differs from other query languages in that is usable across different data sources. There are already 14
> implementations of the spec available. Most of them are free software. There are also billions of
> relations out there that are query-able, thanks to the Linking Open Data project. The structured data of
> Wikipedia is now query-able at DBpedia. Also, have a look at Ivan Herman's presentations on this topic."
