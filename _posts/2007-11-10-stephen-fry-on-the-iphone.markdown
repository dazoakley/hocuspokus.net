Stephen Fry:

> I have been using an Apple iPhone now for more than four months. This is due to an unhealthy mixture of
> friendship with its designer, a slobbery and pathetic love of the new, the possession of an American
> billing address (necessary until today for the activation and use of the device) and a willingness to pay
> preposterous international roaming charges. It puts me in a good position however, to tell you what you're
> in for if you decide to own one of these honeys.
