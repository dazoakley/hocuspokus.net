This has officially just made my day! :D

> Microsoft has officially announced that the Xbox 360 sequel to the popular shooter Gears of War will
> launch in November of this year.
>
> Much of the Xbox 360's first year success was dependent on Epic's Gears of War. It proved much more than
> just substitute until Halo 3 arrived and really showed the gaming quality that the console could deliver.
> In fact, many still favour Marcus Fenix over Master Chief Petty Officer John-117.
