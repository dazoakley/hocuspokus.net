The BBC has announced that it is working on a successor to Tomorrow's World. This was always one of my
favourite shows as a child, (yeah, I know I'm a nerd ;) ), and I'm glad to see something like this making
a return. We need some form of popular science show on TV, otherwise the vast majority of people will
become ignorant of even the basics of science - but that's a rant for another day...

> Just a month after Sir David Attenborough said it was "very, very sad" that Tomorrow's World had been
> axed - five years ago - the BBC has today revealed it is making a "new popular science format for the
> early evening" on BBC1.

> A new science show is one of the BBC's top priorities for BBC1 over the next year, according to its
> annual statements of programme policy for all its TV, radio and online services, published today. The
> SOPPs lay out the corporation's programming plans for the year to the end of March 2009.
