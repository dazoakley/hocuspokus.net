At the moment I'm a very happy user of [Google calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) and
[Spanning Sync](http://www.spanningsync.com/) for all my scheduling needs. But the geek in me fancies
playing about with things so I'm thinking about setting up a CalDav server (when time permits) so Cat
and I can organise our lives accordingly.

Here's some pages I've been reading [whilst](http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/calendarserver)
[doing](http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/emergingtech/macsploitation/archives/who-needs-leopard-server-calendar-server-on-linux-19982)
[my](http://www.mail-archive.com/calendarserver-users@lists.macosforge.org/msg00195/LinuxBuildAndRun-DarwinCalendarServer)
[research](http://sicem.biz/personal/erny/dcs).

Will possibly post more as and when I get a chance to play about with things...
