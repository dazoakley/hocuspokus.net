The new image editing app come Photoshop contender for OS X got its full release today. I have to say
that it does look very good, and at only $59 (less than 30 of our shiny british pounds) any license of
Photoshop (even student ones) are looking way over priced! Will have to give it a go when I get started
on some new project.

> Pixelmator Team today released Pixelmator 1.0, GPU-powered image
> editing tool that provides everything needed to create, edit, and
> enhance still images.
>
> &quot;After two months of bug squashing we are very excited to finally
> release Pixelmator,&quot; said Saulius Dailide of the Pixelmator Team.
> &quot;With its use of latest Mac OS X technologies, breakthrough
> ease-of-use, innovation and low $59 price tag we think all Mac users
> will find Pixelmator very useful and fun.&quot;
