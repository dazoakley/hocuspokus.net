This is a great idea to improve the appearance (and usability) of stacks in Leopard.

> Stacks is pretty much Leopard's only non-eyecandy change to the dock, and it had the potential to be pretty
> handy, but the fact that the icon representing the stack is whatever the top file in the folder happens to
> be really ruins it (for me at least). However, if you haven't yet given up on stacks and thrown them off
> your dock, there is a solution: overlaying stacks icons.
>
> In essence, these are just small-ish semi-transparent icons that are permanently our top icon. This picture
> explain it best (before & after):
