I've been looking forward to the release of the latest in the Zelda series.

> Of all the titles in the Legend of Zelda series, some of the most-respected have been for handheld
> consoles. _Link's Awakening_, the _Oracle_ duo, and _Minish Cap_ all manage to combine on-the-road gaming
> with a certain purity of Zelda-ness. Link's most recent adventure on the small screen, Phantom Hourglass,
> generally continues this tradition and introduces a number of new elements to the property. Unique
> controls, a true sequel, and cel-shaded graphics all make _Hourglass_ stand out from 'traditional' Zelda
> games, and together the whole hangs together fairly well.
