Yesterday was a big day for advanced mobile phones - Android went fully open source.

I really like the iPhone (it will be my next phone) - it's the most complete device out there, but I would love to
see a truly open platform like Android have a great handset underneath it and really take off - it's the only thing
I can see that stands a chance of really taking on the iPhone. (Future unreleased editions of Windows mobile etc.
don't count - we're looking at the here and now, these platforms won't stand still while others try to catch up...)
