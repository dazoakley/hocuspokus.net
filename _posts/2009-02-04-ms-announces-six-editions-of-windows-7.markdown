Should have expected this really. I would have thought producing all of these different versions of the OS
would make development harder and more expensive - why not just produce one or two versions i.e. one for
consumer and one for business use if you really need to segregate and fleece one market? Still at least it's
one different SKU down from Vista's seven!

> Microsoft has announced how it will package Windows Vista's successor, Windows 7. And as ever, Microsoft has
> put segmentation ahead of clarity.
>
> The one bright spot in Microsoft's Windows 7 news is that - contrary to some reports - it won't add a brand
> new edition solely for netbooks. Although even this is not that straight forward.
>
> On Tuesday, the company Tuesday said Windows 7 would come in six editions: Windows 7 Starter Edition, Home
> Basic, Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate.
>
> Not that the news was presented like this. Microsoft led on the fact that "most" customers would be served by
> "two primary" editions - Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional that respectively target consumer
> and business users.
