I like the look of the iPhone - I want one even. But it's hardly the single greatest invention of the
year... Thankfully someone out there has put some reasonable thought into this:

> Invention of the year. Take some time and dwell on that statement for a moment. Not invention of the month.
> Not invention of the week. Not gadget of the year. Invention of the year!
>
> ...
>
> The iPhone may be "pretty" but it certainly does not reduce pollution, protect people from hurricanes,
> distributes solar energy, or allow an amputee to have a finger.
>
> This is not to say the iPhone isn't amazing but to give it Time Magazine's Invention of the Year is truly
> an embarrassment to the magazine.

Definately gadget of the year - but no way invention of the year. There are much more worthy examples in
the article, let's face it, the iPhone won because it'll sell magazines. I sometimes wonder about the
culture of today...
