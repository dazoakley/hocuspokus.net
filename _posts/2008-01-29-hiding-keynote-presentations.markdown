I don't give many presentations these days, but this is a great tip:

> If you give many presentations on the Mac, chances are you're using Apple's Keynote presentation
> software. One cool feature in Keynote is the ability to demo something on your Mac without giving away
> your next slide or notes. When you're in the middle of a presentation, just hit the "h" key on your
> keyboard. This will hide the entire Keynote application and show your desktop.
>
> When you press the h key, the Keynote icon in the dock will change and include a play button. When you
> want to resume your presentation, just click the Keynote icon in the dock.
