These are a great idea for a quick and easy dessert when there's nothing else to hand (they saved me last
night)! Cheers to [Celia](http://desarapen.blogspot.com/2004/12/american-style-pancakes.html)
for the recipe.

#### Ingredients

2 1/2 cups flour<br />
1/4 cup sugar<br />
1 Tbsp baking powder<br />
1/2 tsp salt<br />
2 cups milk or buttermilk<br />
2 eggs - beaten<br />
1/3 cup vegetable oil

#### Method

1.	Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.
2.	Mix all liquid ingredients in another bowl.
3.	Add wet to dry ingredients and stir until mixed. (If the batter looks too thick add water or milk a little at a time until you get the consistency that you want). Let rest for about 10-15 minutes.
4.	Pour onto medium hot greased pan. Once bubbles cover the surface, flip the pancake, cover pan and lower heat for about 1 minute. The cover will help the pancake to rise more.
5.	Remove from pan and serve with butter and syrup.
