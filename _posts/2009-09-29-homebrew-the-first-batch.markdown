I've always fancied trying my hand at a bit of home brewing but never actually found the guts
to get myself a kit. Well, this time I finally went through with it and I'm now the proud owner
of a starter home brewing kit!

I got the kit from the folks at [The Happy Brewer](http://www.thehappybrewer.co.uk/) in
Bedford, it was very reasonably priced, and they were very friendly and happy to explain what
was needed to be done to a complete novice. If you live near the Bedford area and fancy having
a go yourself I'd happily recommend them.

That there is potentially 40 pints of [Woodfordes Wherry](http://www.woodfordes.co.uk/html/wherry.html), 
a very tasty beer sold at the local near the Sanger Institute - fingers crossed I'll do a good
job of it. This is the first fermentation step, in about 4-6 days I can move it into the
barrel, then it's a 3-4 week wait for the finished product. Will update with news on whether I
killed myself (and anyone else brave enough to try it) soon! :)
