Ohhhh, I always fancied looking at EVE. Now all I need to do is get the PhD thesis out of the way and I
might have enough time to look into it. :)

> The official EVE Online site has details of upcoming patch 'Revelations
> 2.3'. Along with a number of bug-fixes to the PvP-focused Massively
> Multiplayer Online Game, this game fix will offer up compatibility
> with Mac OS X and Linux. Though the Mac client is a native port, Linux
> will require the used of Cedega. The post suggests that if you'd like
> a preview of what the game will be like on your rig, you can download
> the client and tool around the test server. System requirements are
> also listed, as are the distributions of Linux they are specifically
> supporting: Ubuntu 7+, Suse 10+, and Linspire 6.
