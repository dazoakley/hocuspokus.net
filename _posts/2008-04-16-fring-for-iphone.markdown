Dan in the office has [Fring](http://www.fring.com) on his Nokia and it seems pretty cool - this looks
quite useful, let's just hope the
[call quality gets improved](http://iphone.macworld.com/2008/04/voip_on_iphone_not_home_yet_le.php)
though (3G should help this out).

> Sure, the iPhone is cool looking, works out a lot, and is really good at math... but it can't do VoIP,
> can it? Well, yes it can -- and you can, thanks to a company called Fring and a piece of ingenious
> software (for jailbreakers only). Using the native app, it's now possible to place and receive calls via
> your WiFi connection, thus making AT&amp;T CEOs cry like little babies. Besides doing Skype and the like,
> the app also lets you connect for chats via MSN Messenger, ICQ, GTalk, SIP, Twitter, AIM, and Yahoo!,
> which should make this an attractive package even if you don't want to harness the raw power of IP
> telephony. You can get the application for free by loading up Installer with the company's repo. Check
> the video after the break to see the magic happen.
