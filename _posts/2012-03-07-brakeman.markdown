Following [this weekends Github hacking fiasco](https://github.com/blog/1068-public-key-security-vulnerability-and-mitigation)
we've started running [brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org/) as part of our
builds at work.  Turned up some interesting things thus far - highly
recommended!!!

There's also a [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Brakeman+Plugin)
available to get nice graphs showing trends over time on your build pages - so
go set that up too if you use Jenkins.
