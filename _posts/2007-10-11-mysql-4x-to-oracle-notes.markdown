> About once a year I need to migrate a medium-sized web application
> using MySQL to Oracle.
>
> Usually it's to prepare a successful intranet application for a move
> to a formally supported production environment - and in Silicon
> Valley, that usually means Oracle.
>
> I was apologizing to Monty at OSCON this year about my latest
> migration project away from MySQL.
>
> His surprising response was, "It's not a bad thing. I don't mind
> hearing about conversions because successful migrations demonstrate
> that people don't have to worry about database lock-in."
>
> Here's some notes on doing migrations.
