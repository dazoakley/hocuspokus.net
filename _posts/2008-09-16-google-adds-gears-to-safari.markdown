This is a worthwhile install if you're a Wordpress user (or any other gears enabled system) on the mac -
great to see some Safari lovin'. :)

> We're really excited to announce the official release of Gears for Safari on OS X (minimum requirements
> are Leopard 10.5.3 or Tiger 10.4.11).
>
> You can download it today from [http://gears.google.com](http://gears.google.com).
>
> This means that you can now access all the Gears-enabled sites (such as Zoho office, WordPress, the new
> YouTube uploader and Google Docs offline) in Safari.
