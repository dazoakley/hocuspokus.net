This made me chuckle so much I had to link to it!
[Omgi's](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=omgi) need to be stopped... ;)

> A 19-year-old Saaarf London girl has been advised to use the Queen's English on the phone after her hunt
> for a cab to whisk her to Bristol airport ended less than satisfactorily.
>
> According to the Daily Mail, the unnamed teen rang directory enquiries two weeks ago and initially
> requested a number for a "Joe Baxi" firm. The nonplussed operator told her she couldn't find anyone by
> that name, to which the lass replied: "It ain't a person, it's a cab, innit."
>
> The enlightened operator duly put her through to Bishop's Stortford-based retail display supplier
> Displaysense, where she "spoke to an equally bemused saleswoman" before thundering: "Look love, how hard
> is it? All I want is your cheapest cab, innit. I need it for 10am. How much is it?"
>
> The answer was &pound;180, and with the deal done by credit card, Displaysense obliged by delivering a
> display cabinet to her door the next morning.
