If you're a VMware user and want to play around with the latest version of Ubuntu in a VM (like me),
you'll need to get the vmware-tools installed. Unfortunately, things are not quite as
[straight forward as the previous release](/2007/11/installing-vmware-tools-on-ubuntu-gutsy/)
of Ubuntu yet, but it was a pretty easy thanks to this
[great guide](http://peterc.org/2008/62-how-to-install-vmware-tools-on-ubuntu-hardy-804-under-vmware-fusion.html).

> The latest version of Ubuntu (8.04 a.k.a. Ubuntu Hardy - the world's most popular Linux distribution)
> came out yesterday on April 24th. I downloaded it right away to play with on VMware Fusion, my Mac
> virtualization tool of choice (though I've now been told this works in VMware Workstation and VMware
> Player on the PC too!). It worked pretty well out of the box, with even seamless mouse support working
> right away, but I needed, of course, to install VMware Tools too, as any good VMware user would do. From
> there, things turned sour, and I was bombarded with error messages ...
