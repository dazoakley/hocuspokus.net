This could be most useful in the near future...

> Most web applications have many more model objects exposed on the backend, or admin side, than they do on
> the front. Coding interfaces for all those models is redundant and a waste of resources when all you need
> is CRUD functionality that's smart enough to handle all your ActiveRecord associations.
>
> [ActiveScaffold](http://activescaffold.com/) is a Ruby on Rails plugin that provides you with a wealth of
> dynamically created goodness, just plug the ActiveScaffold into your controller, you can have a AJAXified
> table interface for creating, updating, and deleting objects then. It has the following main features as
> well.
>
> * Automatic handling of ActiveRecord associations
> * Sorting, Search and Pagination
> * Graceful JavaScript degradation
> * RESTful API support (XML/YAML/JSON) baked in
> * Sexy CSS styling and theming support
