I had some left over pheasant meat (breast and leg) to go with [the stock](/2010/12/pheasant-stock/) 
that I made the other night, so I decided to make a nice risotto out if it. :)

The following quantities are for two servings.

#### Ingredients

* Left over roast pheasant meat, cut into small pieces
* 2 large portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 6 dried porchini mushrooms
* 500ml pheasant stock
* 2 knobs of butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 large shallots, finely chopped
* 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
* 160g arborio rice
* 1 glass red wine
* 1 tsp dried mixed herbs
* The juice of half a lemon
* 50g parmesan cheese

#### Directions

Rehydrate the porcini mushrooms in a little boiling water for 15 minutes. Remove the mushrooms
and slice, then strain the leftover mushroom water and add to the pheasant stock.

Heat the stock. In a separate, heavy bottomed saucepan, gently saut&eacute; shallots and garlic
in the olive oil and one knob of butter until soft.

Add the rice to the saucepan, turn up the heat and gently stir. After a minute or so the rice
will become translucent. Now add the wine and keep stirring.

Once the wine has cooked into the rice add a ladle of hot stock, a good pinch of salt and the
dried herbs. Now turn the heat down to a simmer and keep stirring gently.

Once the first ladle full of stock has been absorbed, add another one and keep stirring. Repeat
this for about 10 minutes (stirring and adding stock).

Now add the pheasant meat and mushrooms to the saucepan, and carry on adding stock and stirring
for a further 5 minutes. (So this will be about 15 minutes cooking time for the rice in total).

Now taste the rice to see if it's cooked (also check the seasoning at this point). Carry on
adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. If you run out of stock before the
rice is cooked, add some boiling water and keep going.

Remove from the heat and add the last knob of butter and the parmesan, stir well. Place a lid
on the saucepan and allow it to sit for 2 minutes - this allows the risotto to become all
creamy and oozy like it should be.

Finally, add the lemon juice, stir, then serve immediately.
