Hakon Wium Lie (CTO of Opera):

> In the area of web browsers, Opera Software has proposed a specific kind of remedy - that Microsoft only
> be allowed to distribute standards-compliant browsers. Microsoft's IE is bug-ridden and the company,
> despite its vast resources, has shown little interest in fixing problems that cost web designers time and
> sleep. IE dominates the web due to its being bundled with Windows. This forces web designers to
> prioritize coding for IE. Coding for standards-compliant browsers becomes a secondary consideration.
>
> Microsoft is keenly aware of this and therefore has little interest in improving their support for
> standards. They will never become standards compliant unless forced by someone in a position to demand a
> change, something that users and customers are not. Requiring standard compliance would greatly lessen
> Microsoft's monopolistic stranglehold in the web browser market, would delight web developers everywhere
> and would, ironically, make IE a better product.
