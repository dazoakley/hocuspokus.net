A great little command-line tool for Leopard:

> `osx-trash` manipulates the Mac OS X trash from the command line, just like the Finder does. It uses
> AppleScript via Scripting Bridge on top of to communicate with the Finder. You can move files to the
> trash, empty the trash, and list items currently in the trash.
