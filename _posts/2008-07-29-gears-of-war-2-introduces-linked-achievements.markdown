Looks like people better get playing the original Gears leading up to November!!! (I know I will be... ;) )

> Gears of War 2 will feature 'linked Achievements,' meaning that Achievements earned in the original Gears
> will help unlock bonuses in the sequel.
>
> Epic's Cliff Bleszinski took the stage at Comic-Con to demonstrate to a live audience the E3 Sinkhole
> level and describe a new "linked achievements" feature for Gears 2 where achievements unlocked in the
> first Gears game would open features in the upcoming sequel.
>
> He offered three examples of how the system would work:
>
> * Complete Act One in Gears Of War and receive a playable Anthony Carmine in Gears of War 2
> * Find 10 COG tags in Gears Of War and get Minh Young Kim in Gears of War 2
> * Kill Raam in Gears Of War and earn a playable Raam in Gears of War 2
>
> Questions such as whether all Gears of Wars achievements will be linked to the sequel and what other
> goodies can be grabbed besides characters won't be answered until closer to the game's November 7
> release.
