Sounds like a good new feature...

> Google is set on Wednesday to launch a new feature in its Google Maps
> for Mobile program that automatically sets your location even in phones
> that lack a global positioning system (GPS) device.
>
> Until now, if you were in a cafe and you wanted to search for a nearby
> photocopy shop, you had to type in an address to set your location
> before Google Maps for Mobile could provide local listings.
>
> The beta feature triangulates your approximate location based on nearby
> cell towers so you don't have to type in your address. Given that less
> than 15 percent of mobile phones are GPS-enabled, this feature will be
> helpful to many people.
