I'm already a lover of [Spanning Sync](http://www.spanningsync.com/), version 2 promises to have contact
syncing between all your Google apps with the Mac address book. This could be very very good. Check the
link for a video of it in action.

> People know Spanning Sync for its ability to sync Apple iCal with Google Calendar. In fact, more than
> 70,000 people have used Spanning Sync to do just that. But calendars are only one part of the equation.
>
> Our users tell us that they also need to be able to sync their Mac Address Book with their contacts in
> Gmail and Google Apps. So Spanning Sync 2.0 does both calendars and contacts.
