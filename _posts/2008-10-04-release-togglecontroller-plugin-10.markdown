I've just spent the last week on a Javascript and Ajax course (thanks to work for footing the bill)! As such I come
armed with some newfound javascript knowledge! :)

Here's the first fruits of my labour - a very simple [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) plugin that enables you to
unobtrusively make an element on a webpage collapsable, and have the showing/hiding controlled by another element.

Like I said, this is very basic stuff and there is probably about a million other (most likely more feature-full and
better) plugins that do the same thing already on the web, but it's all I really need for it to be useful for my
stuff and I had fun learning how to do this - never know someone else may find it useful!

If you want to have a play, the code is on [github](https://github.com/dazoakley/jquery.togglecontrol.js).
