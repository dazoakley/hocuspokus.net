I've just got one of the new [Apple wireless keyboards](http://www.apple.com/uk/keyboard/). I have to say
- i'm very impressed with it! It's incredibly thin, good to look at, and doesn't seem to gather as much
crap in it as the old Apple keyboard. :)

Little did I know that it's even quite smart about people hitting the caps lock key by accident. I like
it even more now (as I do hit the caps lock key quite a lot by accident)!
