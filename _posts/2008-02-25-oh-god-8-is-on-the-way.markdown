Hold onto your hats people, it looks like Microsoft is getting IE8 somewhere near usable. It's started a
private beta test already with a public one set to follow... Let's hope they do a u-turn on this stupid
version meta tag and have the damn thing render in "super-standards" mode from the outset.

> So far we know that Microsoft claims that IE 8 will pass the ACID 2 compatibility test and include
