The chaps over at Google have come up with a neat webservice - an easy way to get charts onto your
webpages, the [Google Chart API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/).

> Google has finally released Google Charts API, which returns a PNG-format image in response to a URL.
> Several types of image can be generated: line, bar, and pie charts for example. For each image type you can
> specify attributes such as size, colors, and labels.
>
> You can include a Chart API image in a webpage by embedding a URL within an `<img>` tag. When the webpage
> is displayed in a browser the Chart API renders the image within the page.
