I went to an event called [Cloudcamb](http://cloudcamb.org/) last night (I love working in Cambridge)
organised by [Matt](http://twitter.com/mza) (ta very muchly), the evening was very good and informative, but
the one thing that really stood out for me was a very interesting presentation on the [Biocep
project](http://biocep-distrib.r-forge.r-project.org/) that anyone who uses R (or would like to use R) should
be interested in.

Here's my take on the basics of it and why you would want this - there's really LOTS more there!!!

The first thing Biocep is (that's not really advertised much on the site) is that it offers a vastly improved
interface to R that has the following tools:

* Built-in spreadsheet like functionallity
* Built-in code editor ([jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/))
* Plug-in architecture for creating custom interfaces to things (similar potential to Matlab's GUIDE)

There are other R gui's out there (i.e. Mac and Windows R spring to mind) - but they are not as slick as
this.

The second thing biocep gives is that it allows you to run R instances on remote machines (i.e. up in the
"cloud", or on clusters or grid systems in your work place / institute), from your desktop and be able to
work collaboratively with other people using fully shared sessions (i.e. both of you can play with shared
data, talk and see all of the visuals the other person is seeing all in real-time - it's really impressive to
watch).

Seriously, if you work with R, check it out!
