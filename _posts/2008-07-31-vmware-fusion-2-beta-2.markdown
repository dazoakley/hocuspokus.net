It's got friggin' Unity for Linux!!!  This looks good...

> The VMWare team has [just released](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2008/07/safer-stronger.html)
> [the second beta for VMWare Fusion 2.0](http://www.vmware.com/communities/content/beta/fusion/fusion2_beta2.html),
> the company's popular virtualization program for the Mac.
>
> The new beta adds a TON of new features, as the video above demonstrates. I got a chance to talk to
> VMWare today about the new beta and it is HOT. I'll be posting a more in-depth overview tomorrow, but
> until then, here are some of the highlights:
>
> * __Unity 2.0__ - The newest version of Fusion is really focused on better Windows-Mac integration. You can now launch Windows programs from the dock or access Mac programs from within your virtual machine. You can also link folders like Documents, Pictures and Music on your virtual machine with those folders on your Mac.
> * __Multiple Snapshots__ VMWare has worked really hard to bring a Time Machine-like ease to backing up and protecting your virtual machine. You can now designate how often you want to take full system snapshots of your VM, whether once an hour, once a day or once a week, and how many copies you want to keep.
> * __Better Video and Graphics Graphics__ and shading support has been improved for Macs that have higher-end graphics cards, and even integrated Macs can now play 1080p HD video in virtual machines with considerably less CPU overhead.
> * __Support for more client OSs__, including Leopard Server You can now run Leopard Server as a VM in OS X 10.4 and 10.5, even on client machines (virtualizing Mac OS X client is blocked by Apple's license terms). Support for the latest version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (Hardy Heron) is also available right out of the box with Unity integration. Power users can now designate up to four virtual CPUs per virtual machine, which is great for anyone wanting to take an XServe or Mac Pro to the next level.

> [VMWare Fusion 2.0 beta 2](http://communities.vmware.com/community/beta/fusion) is available for Intel
> Macs running OS X 10.4 or OS X 10.5. New users can try the beta for free and the upgrade path (including
> future betas and the full version of Fusion 2.0) is free for all existing Fusion 1.0 customers.
