An interesting article over at
[Wired](http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/commentary/games/2008/09/gamesfrontiers_0908)
discussing a recent study into how kids are using their brains and scientific reasoning to beat video
games...

> One of the reasons kids get bored by science is that too many teachers present it as a fusty collection
> of facts for memorization. This is precisely wrong. Science isn't about facts. It's about the quest for
> facts -- the scientific method, the process by which we hash through confusing thickets of ignorance.
> It's dynamic, argumentative, collaborative, competitive, filled with flashes of crazy excitement and
> hours of drudgework, and driven by ego: Our desire to be the one who figures it out, at least for now.
> It's dramatic and nutty and fun.
>
> And it's pretty much how kids already approach the games they love. They're already scientists; they
> already know the value of the scientific method. Teachers just need to talk to them in their language, so
> that the kids can begin to understand the joy of puzzling through the offline, "real" world too.
