Yay! Halo 3 is out tomorrow and getting good reviews. I think i'd better get ready to rush into my local
Game at some point tomorrow!

> From a certain point of view, *Halo 3* is without a doubt
> the biggest game of the year. The combination of fan anticipation,
> marketing, and the skill of Bungie's design combine to create a game
> that's larger than life; if gaming has a blockbuster franchise to
> match the movie industry's punch, it's the tale of Master Chief. The
> importance of the *Halo* franchise to gaming is a very big
> issue, though, and one worth it's own article. Having played through
> the game, there's really only one question I'm here to answer
> today. Does it meet expectations? In a word: yes. It's not the best
> game ever made, and it may not even be the best game this year. Will
> it make the fans happy, and deservedly sell thousands of Xbox
> 360s? Very much yes.
