Great news! Straight from the horses mouth, (well, Steve's anyway) Apple have announced that an iPhone
SDK will be coming in February.

> Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the
> iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developers' hands in February. We
> are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community
> around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our
> users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware
> and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best
> mobile platform ever for developers.

__Update__: if that dissapears (as there seems to be no permalink for this article), have a read of
[Mac Rumors copy](http://www.macrumors.com/2007/10/17/steve-jobs-announces-3rd-party-sdk-for-iphone-for-february-2008/)
of the whole article.
