I'm a fan of the [Tails plugin](http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/) for Firefox...  Now Safari (on Leopard) gets its own [Microformats Plugin](http://zappatic.net/safarimicroformats/)! :)

>Of course, in order to take advantage of Microformats and perhaps bring the information they offer onto your system, you need a browser that will read them - there's Firefox plugins, and NetNewsWire 3.0's built-in browser reads them. But what about Safari? Thanks to SIMBL, there's a small array of Safari plugins available and from the maker of Safari Tidy comes Safari Microformats. Whenever visiting a site with Microformats, an icon appears in the right of the address bar (not unlike the RSS icon). Clicking it brings up a menu of available hCards and hCalendars you can add to Address Book and iCal.
