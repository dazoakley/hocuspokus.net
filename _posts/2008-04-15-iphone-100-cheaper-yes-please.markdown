> O2 will cut &pound;100 off the price of the Apple iPhone tomorrow, it has been claimed. Carphone
> Warehouse is said to be planning to match the move.

> There's no official confirmation yet, of course. The claim was

> website Mobile Today.

> If O2 and CW do knock &pound;100 off the price of the iPhone, taking the handset's price to &pound;169,
> it will undoubtedly further fuel speculation that carriers are clearing out stocks of the 2.5G phone
> ahead of the widely anticipated introduction of a 3G version in June.
