[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/) are running a story with pics for HP's answer to the Eee PC. It does
look quite sweet, but no details of the full spec or final price as yet.

If they could pitch this about the same price as the Eee - I could see this being quite sweet... However,
it says that it can come with Vista or Linux - my bet is that it's going to be a touch more powerful than
the Eee (it'll need to be if Vista is an option!), and a shedload more cash!!! Please let me be wrong,
(on the cash point ;) )!
