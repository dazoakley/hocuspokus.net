I made roast pheasant for the first time at the weekend (using
[this recipe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roastpheasantwithlem_90249 "Roast Pheasant with Lemon and Rosemary - BBC Recipes")
- very nice!) so it meant that I ended up with the bones and carcasses from two pheasants.
It would have been rude not to try and make a stock from them!

The following makes enough for about 4 servings.

#### Ingredients

* 2 pheasant carcasses and bones
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 sliced medium onion
* 1 carrot - peeled, trimmed and sliced
* 1 celery stalk - trimmed and sliced
* 3 large shallots, sliced
* 2 tomatoes - coarsely chopped
* 4 bay leaves
* 4 juniper berries, crushed
* 20 peppercorns
* 2 1/2 cup dry red wine
* 1 cup water or more

#### Directions

Preheat the oven to 450 &deg;F / 230 &deg;C / Gas Mark 8.

Pour the vegetable oil into a roasting pan with the reserved bones and carcasses. Roast until
well browned, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.

Add the remaining stock ingredients except the wine and continue to roast for 10 more minutes.

Transfer the solids to a stockpot, discarding any fat.

Place the roasting tin over high heat and add the wine. Scrape away all browned bits and boil,
stirring, until the wine is nearly evaporated.

Add 1 cup of water, then add this liquid to the stockpot.

Add enough cold water to cover the bones and carcasses, bring slowly to a boil and skim well.

Lower the heat and gently simmer uncovered for 3 to 4 hours.

Strain, pressing down on the solids to extract all of the liquid, then the discard solids.
Allow the stock to cool to room temperature and then refrigerate.

When the stock is chilled, lift off any solidified fat from the surface and discard.
