Just read this post on Slashdot:

My opinion - tell him where to go. I thought the idea of a trademark was that you had to actively be using
that name in a trade? He has no brand, no real business using that name (you can't claim a static page full
of AdSense links is a real business), and no product. He doesn't have any sort of case, he's just trying to
bully the guy into give over his domain name... I hate stuff like this, when I was looking for a new domain
name, every decent name I thought of was home to some troll like this. :(
