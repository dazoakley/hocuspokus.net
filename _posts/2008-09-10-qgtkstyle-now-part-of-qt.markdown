Looks like KDE apps just got a whole lot more appealing to Gnome users. I like a lot of KDE apps (Kate being a
particularly cool editor when I'm on the Linux box), but I just never used to use them much as they looked too out
of place with the rest of my Gnome desktop (yeah, I guess I'm a GUI snob...) - this will most likely change that!

> QGtkStyle made it's way into the Qt snapshots this week, meaning it will become part of the Qt 4.5 release.
> Technical users can already compile and use it on their own desktop, but once Qt 4.5 is out it will simply replace
> Cleanlooks as the default application style Qt uses on GNOME desktops.
