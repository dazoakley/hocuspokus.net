Late to the game as always, I finally got onto [COD4](http://www.callofduty.com/) last night.

Oh. my. god. This game is frigging awesome!

I had no idea what I was doing half the time, and spent most of the night watching replays of how I died,
but I haven't had a laugh like this with a game since [Gears of War](http://gearsofwar.com/) came out.
[Halo 3](http://www.halo3.com/) was good, great even - but it just didn't have that stand out 'you're
gonna remember this' feeling to it, it was just more, well, Halo.

Maybe this is because COD4 is my first COD game and i've just been missing out all of these years (the
WWII stuff never really appealed).

Anyway, enough of my rambling... If you own a machine capable of gaming in anyway, be it Xbox, PS3, Wii,
PC, your toaster, whatever - you need to try out COD4.

Oh, and for real giggles, try an 18 player free-for-all on the world's smallest map 'Shipment'. I think I
had on average about 5 seconds between respawns! :D
