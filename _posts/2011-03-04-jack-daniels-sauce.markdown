It feels like this is turning into a food blog... lol!

Anyways, I've been wanting to make a Jack Daniel's sauce for a long while, and after a bit
of research on the interwebs and a little experimentation I settled on this simple recipe.
It tastes fantastic as a dipping sauce or glaze with chicken, steak, shrimp and chips!

#### Ingredients

* 1/3 cup red onions, diced
* 1/4 tsp garlic, crushed
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 1/3 cup teriyaki marinade
* 1/3 cup pineapple juice
* 1/2 cup jack daniel's whisky
* 1/2 tsp tabasco sauce
* 3 tsp cornflour mixed with 3 tsp water

#### Directions

In a thick bottomed saucepan, gently fry the onions and garlic in a little olive oil until
the onions start to soften.

Now add the rest of the ingredients except the cornflour mixture. Bring to the boil and
gently simmer.

After about 35 minutes slowly add the cornflour mixture stirring constantly until the
correct consistency is reached.

Use straight away whilst warm or you can keep it in a clean jam jar (or something like) 
in the fridge for a while.
