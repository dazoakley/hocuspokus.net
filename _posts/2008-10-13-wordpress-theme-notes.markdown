I've been working on a theme for wordpress over the last few weeks (on and off), it turns out to be really quite
simple, you just need to find out where to get started...

Here's some pages that I found most useful (linking for future reference):

* [How to create a wordpress theme from scratch](http://nettuts.com/site-builds/how-to-create-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/)
* [How to create a wordpress theme from scratch - Part 2](http://nettuts.com/working-with-cmss/how-to-create-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch-part-2/)
* [Wordpress template tag reference guide](http://www.dbswebsite.com/design/wordpress-reference/)
* [The Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/)
