If you, like most of the world, are a Windows user, having to run things such as anti-virus and
anti-spyware programs are just a part of everyday life to try and keep your system running nicely.

My personal favorite, that I install on all the Windows PCs that I regularly have to keep in check
(family, friends who haven't seen the light of Mac or Linux etc.) is [AVG](http://free.grisoft.com/).
Great news is that AVG plan to release the new free edition of AVG 8.0 on Thursday now with added spyware
protection to boot! Great news, and sounds like it could be an essential upgrade.

> AVG Technologies plans to release a revamped version of its popular, free anti-malware scanner on
> Thursday.
>
> Version 8.0 of the software will add anti-spyware and safe search features to its core anti-virus engine.
> Safe surfing features, that give users warnings about visiting insecure websites all the time not just
> when they search, will remain a paid feature of AVG's full fat product.
>
> Both the safe search and safe surfing features use Linkscanner technology, acquired by AVG when it bought
> Exploit Prevention Labs last December
