Yet more chart drawing goodness. This takes a different approach to the Google model by generating really
good looking graphs all on the client-side in javascript - very nice!

> [Flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) is a pure Javascript plotting library for jQuery. It produces
> graphical plots of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly client-side. The focus is on simple usage (all settings
> are optional), attractive looks and interactive features like zooming. Although Flot is easy to use, it is
> also advanced enough to be suitable for Web 2.0 data mining/business intelligence purposes which is its
> original application. The plugin is targeting all newer browsers.
