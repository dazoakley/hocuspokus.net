I like...

> I've heard some great things about the tiny little eeePC, but this is the best thing I've heard so far:
> [it can be a Mac](http://picasaweb.google.com/iiyoyoguy/EeeMac?authkey=eovSurACcNc&pli=1&gsessionid=TbPELrv-fYwr9yBsOPnvrw#5244497584249019010).
> Twitterer Gregory Cohen has pictures on Picasa of his completed eeeMac, an eeePC transformed (perhaps in
> similar fashion to this previous attempt -- details please, Gregory) into an OS X-running ultraportable,
> complete with a tiny little lit Apple logo on the back.
