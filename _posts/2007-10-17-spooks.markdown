One of the only shows on TV worth watching these days came back onto the BBC last night, bloody hell was
it good!

If you've never seen or even heard of spooks before, get yourself over to the
[wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooks), read up about it, watch the
[catch up clip](http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/series6_ep1.shtml) of last nights
episode and be there next Tuesday at 9pm, BBC1!
