This is yet another example of why I want to upgrade to Leopard...

> Quick Look is a beautiful thing, and in my view practically itself worth the cost of admission to Leopard.
> Unfortunately, the more you get used to it, the more annoying it is when you get to a file format that
> Quick Look doesn't support. Fortunately, Apple was smart enough to design Quick Look with an open
> architecture that allows developers to write their own plugins and support more file formats, which
> Japanese developer Taiyo used to write two excellent plugins.
>
> The first addresses a serious annoyance with the default Quick Look implementation on folders. If you
> invoke Quick Look with a folder selected in the Finder you'll get...a picture of the folder icon. Frankly,
> that's pretty stupid. Taiyo's [Folder Quick Look Plugin](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071124/p3) fixes
> this by displaying the folder's contents, which is how it should have been done in the first place.
> Likewise, Taiyo's [Zip Quick Look Plugin](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071125/p2) displays the contents
> of zip files.
