Read this post and it just made me chuckle to myself...

> Packard Bell is set to reposition itself as a trendy design-focused lifestyle brand, following its acquisition by
> Acer last year.

> "It's not a totally new positioning. We've always differentiated ourselves through design, but as a smaller company

>
> "Now with Acer behind us, we want to create aficionado fans of our products. We want people to have real desire for

Here's what happened last time I saw a PB that was trying to be "trendy":

Those things were a piece of crap, (and fuuuuugly) always falling apart and loads got returned... Let's hope these
are much improved - if not, it will always give us a laugh! :)
