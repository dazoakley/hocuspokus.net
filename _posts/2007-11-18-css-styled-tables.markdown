Veerle comes up with another look at styling tables with CSS. A great read.

> In 2005 I wrote an article about styling a table with CSS. After
> receiving so many requests I finally decided to give in and write
> another tutorial. Seems like a popular topic and an interesting
> one to share some tricks on how you can nicely style them. This
> article is about the proper usage of tables, for tabular data. How you
> can implement them with accessibility in mind and how to make them
> appealing for the eye using CSS.
