[IconGrabber](http://lipidity.com/apple/icongrabber/) is a useful little application for getting an OS X
applications icon for use on the web. It's also available as a
[Quicksilver plugin](http://lipidity.com/plugins/quicksilver/icongrabber/).

> It couldn't be easier. Just drop the file or folder that you want
> the icon from onto IconGrabber, and choose a place to save it. The
> extension you choose determines the format, otherwise it defaults to
> tiff. That's it!
