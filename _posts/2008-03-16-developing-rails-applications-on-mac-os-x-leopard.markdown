First in a series of three articles from Apple on Ruby on Rails development on Mac OS X Leopard.
Definitely worth a bookmark.

> Ruby on Rails is a popular and powerful open source web framework for rapidly creating high-quality web
> applications to help you keep up with the speed of the Web. Rails is thriving on Mac OS X, and Leopard
> comes pre-installed with Ruby, Rails, Mongrel, Capistrano, Subversion, and other tools that help to
> streamline the development and deployment of Rails applications. In addition, the Organizer feature of
> XCode 3.0 keeps your development workflow efficient.
>
> This article gives you a full tour of Ruby on Rails 2.0 on Leopardâ€”starting with building a web
> application using the latest Rails features with Xcode 3.0, and finishing with deploying the application
> to a production server running Leopard Server. Along the way we'll explore unique features and benefits
> that Leopard brings to the party. In the end you'll be better equipped to consider the advantages of
> powering your web application with Rails on Leopard.
>
> This is the first in a series of three articles:
>
> * This article on Development, where you learn to build a basic RESTful Rails application using Xcode 3.0;
> * Customization, where we discuss working with views and web forms, adding AJAX support, and supporting an iPhone interface;
> * Deployment, where we set up version control, write a Capistrano recipe, and deploy on Leopard Server.
>
> Together they will give you a great start in working with Rails on Mac OS X Leopard.
