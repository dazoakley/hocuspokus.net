Welcome to the introductory post to [hocuspokus.net](http://hocuspokus.net)! So, what's going on here
then?!?

Well, basically this is going to be a place for me, Darren Oakley to dump my thoughts and little ideas
that I have on a semi-regular basis... Expect posts on subjects such as Apple (god - not another mac
blogger!), Perl programming, Bioinformatics (it's what I do for a living), Unix geekiness, Xbox 360 and
many things in between as I go about my daily life.

Anyway - enough of this boring first post nonsense! Will be back soon with more interesting things to
say!
