I really like the Eee PC - some people at work here have them, and if I could get it past the wife, i'd
happily have one! ;)

Seems like the well spoken geek Stephen Fry is quite a fan too:

> The Asus EEE PC perched on my knee combines GNU software with a Linux kernel powered by an Intel Celeron

> adaptors are available for networking and internet connections, three USB ports, mini-jack sockets for
