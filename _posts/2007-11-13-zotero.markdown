[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) is a new reference management tool that comes in the form of a Firefox
(and Flock) extension. It looks like it could be a very good (and free) alternative to commercial reference
management software tools like Endnote and Reference Manager. It even has plugins for
[Word and OpenOffice](http://www.zotero.org/documentation/word_processor_integration) for
cite-while-you-write functionality, and [Wordpress](http://dev.zotero.org/wordpress) so that writers of
Wordpress based blogs can ensure that their posts are cleanly imported for users of Zotero.

> Zotero [zoh-TAIR-oh] is a free, easy-to-use Firefox extension to help you collect, manage, and cite your
> research sources. It lives right where you do your work - in the web browser itself.

If you have any potential use for reference management (i.e. if you are a student or scientist) - I
seriously recommend checking this out.
