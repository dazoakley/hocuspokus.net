Last week I enjoyed some time up in Edinburgh for the [International Workshop on Portals for
Life Sciences (IWPLS '09)](http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/1000/), hosted at the e-Science
Institute. It was a good workshop - there were good presentations, lively debates, and good
social planning for the evenings!

I have to admit that quite a lot of the content of the workshop was completely irrelevant to me
and went straight over my head at times, but I did enjoy it, and it's good to hear what other
people are doing.

I was there for two reasons, first was an interest in the content of the workshop, and second
was that I was one of the people presenting a lightning talk! The content of my talk was pretty
different to most of the other presentations - they were mostly about grid computing and
development of portal interfaces for said grids - whereas mine was about the architecture I
developed for the new [Sanger Mouse Resources Portal](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/).

It seemed to go down pretty well, it got a couple of laughs, no one fell asleep and quite a few
asked questions at the end, so I was quite happy at that. Here's the slides from the talk, just
in case anyone would like to take a look. Copies of all the presentations from the workshop can
be found [here](http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action/esi/contribution.cfm?Title=1000).
