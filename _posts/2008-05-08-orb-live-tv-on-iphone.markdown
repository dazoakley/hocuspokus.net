That's it, I REALLY want an iPhone now...

> You don't need Steve Jobs' permission to watch TV on your iPhone any more. And you don't need to pay the
> cable company twice. A native Orb client for the iPhone and iPod Touch popped up on the installer
> networks overnight, and Orb confirms that it's official.
>
> The client software allows you to watch live TV on an iPhone or Touch wherever you are, in addition to
> your music. You'll need a TV card or adaptor for your PC, of course, to get the live TV. So provided you
> have an internet connection, there's no need to perform DIY transcoding using software such as Visual
> Hub. The client will even transcode the video stream nicely for 2.75G Edge networks. Orb does in software
> what Sling Media does in hardware.
